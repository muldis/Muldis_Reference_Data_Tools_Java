**IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This repository, with the Java version of "Muldis Reference Data Tools",
is currently lagging far behind the .NET version of the same.
For now you should see the .NET version instead to have a better idea where
this will all be going.
In the near future this Java version will be rewritten so it is as up to
date as the .NET version.**

This repository or distribution features the following projects,
each of which is intended to produce its own JAR for distribution;
they are listed in dependency order:

1. [Muldis Data Library: Java (MDLib)](docs/Muldis_Data_Library.md) - Library implementation of Muldis Data Language

1. [Muldis Object Notation Processor Reference: Java (MUONP)](docs/Muldis_Object_Notation_Processor_Reference.md) - Reference implementation of MUON processing utilities

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This repository, with the Java version of "Muldis Reference Data Tools",
may sometimes lag behind the .NET version of the same,
so it is worth also looking at the latter for additional content.**

they are listed in dependency order:

1. [Muldis Data Library: Java (MDLib)](docs/Muldis_Data_Library.md) - Library implementation of Muldis Data Language

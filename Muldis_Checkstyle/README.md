# NAME

Muldis Checkstyle: Java (MCS) - Checkstyle Configuration For Muldis Java Projects

# VERSION

The fully-qualified name of what this document describes is
`com.muldis:muldis-checkstyle:0.1` or alternately
`Muldis_Checkstyle https://muldis.com 0.1`.

# DESCRIPTION

This distribution features the Checkstyle configuration file
[src/main/resources/Muldis_Checkstyle.xml](
src/main/resources/Muldis_Checkstyle.xml) and its support structure.

This distribution empowers generating a same-versioned JAR file for
`Muldis_Checkstyle.xml` which is suitable for consumption by other Java
projects that want their source code to conform to the Checkstyle rules it
defines, and it is used by all of the other main Muldis Java projects.

See <https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io> for the canonical Checkstyle
reference documentation; we use version 8.41.1.

# USAGE

To install the Muldis Checkstyle JAR as a managed plugin external
dependency of a Java project that is managed with Maven, add Maven
Checkstyle Plugin configuration to its `pom.xml` file like the content of
the file [examples/pom-snippet.xml](examples/pom-snippet.xml).

The same Java project will also require a file named `import-control.xml`
at its root directory whose content is like the file
[examples/import-control.xml](examples/import-control.xml).

When using the example Maven Checkstyle Plugin configuration, the simplest
and fastest way to test Checkstyle conformance of the project is to run
`mvn clean validate`.  Running most other commands such as `mvn clean
install` will also do it as an early part of their regular actions.
